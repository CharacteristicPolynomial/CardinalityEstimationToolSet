# Cardinality Estimation Tool Set
## Intro
I'm trying to write a library to do numerical analysis on CE.

We focus on the kind of methods which is parametrized by a tuple (m,q,h), where m is the number of independent copies, q is the base and h is the window height.

A tuple (m,q,h) defines a unique memory access scheme. A commutative and idempotent memory access scheme (CIMAS) takes n as input and generates an end state. The state is recorded in the form of "logn d1 d2 ... dm". 

A tuple (m,q,h) also defines a unique maximum likelihood estimator.
